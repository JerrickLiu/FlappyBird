# Flappy Bird
Python script to play the game Flappy Bird using PyGame

## Installation

This script only requires pygame and the image sprites I used. Use pip to install to pygame.

```bash
python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
```

In the code, specify the path to the images for it to work. 

## Usage

Once running, press space to play. Navigate the bird to flap between the pipes, making sure not to hit them.
